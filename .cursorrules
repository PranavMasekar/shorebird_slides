# Flutter macOS Presentation App Rules

## Project Context
This is a Flutter macOS application designed exclusively for presentation purposes using the flutter_deck package. The app uses League Spartan font from google_fonts package.

## macOS-Specific UI Guidelines

### Text Styling for Presentations
1. **Font Sizes**: Use larger font sizes appropriate for presentations viewed on large screens:
   - Headings: 48-72px (or 48-72 logical pixels)
   - Subheadings: 32-48px
   - Body text: 24-32px
   - Small text/captions: 18-24px
   - Minimum readable text: 18px (never smaller)

2. **League Spartan Font Usage**:
   - Always use `GoogleFonts.leagueSpartan()` for text styling
   - Use appropriate font weights: 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semi-bold), 700 (bold)
   - For headings, prefer weights 600-700
   - For body text, use weights 400-500
   - Example: `GoogleFonts.leagueSpartan(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.w700)`

3. **Text Contrast and Readability**:
   - Ensure high contrast between text and background (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
   - Use dark text on light backgrounds or light text on dark backgrounds
   - Avoid subtle color differences that work on mobile but may be hard to read on projectors

4. **Line Height and Spacing**:
   - Use generous line height (1.4-1.6x font size) for better readability
   - Add adequate spacing between paragraphs (16-24px minimum)
   - Use letter spacing of 0-0.5px for headings if needed for clarity

### Layout and Spacing

1. **Screen Dimensions**:
   - Design for typical presentation screen sizes (1920x1080, 2560x1440, etc.)
   - Use responsive layouts that scale well across different screen sizes
   - Consider safe areas but remember presentations are typically fullscreen

2. **Padding and Margins**:
   - Use larger padding values (32-64px) compared to mobile apps
   - Slide content should have generous margins (48-80px from edges)
   - Group related content with consistent spacing

3. **Widget Sizing**:
   - Buttons and interactive elements should be larger (minimum 48px height)
   - Icons should be sized appropriately (32-48px for standard icons, 64-96px for emphasis)
   - Images should be high resolution and properly scaled

### Color and Visual Design

1. **Color Palette**:
   - Use high-contrast color schemes suitable for projectors
   - Avoid very light or very subtle colors that may not display well
   - Test color combinations for visibility in various lighting conditions

2. **Backgrounds**:
   - Prefer solid colors or subtle gradients over complex patterns
   - Ensure backgrounds don't interfere with text readability
   - Consider dark mode compatibility for presentation environments

### Flutter Deck Specific Guidelines

1. **Slide Structure**:
   - Keep slides focused on single concepts
   - Use FlutterDeckSlide widgets consistently
   - Leverage FlutterDeckSlideTheme for consistent styling across slides

2. **Slide Content**:
   - Use FlutterDeckTitleSlide for title slides
   - Use FlutterDeckSectionSlide for section dividers
   - Keep content concise and scannable
   - Use bullet points sparingly and make them large enough to read

3. **Animations and Transitions**:
   - Use subtle animations that enhance understanding, not distract
   - Ensure transitions are smooth and professional
   - Test animations on actual presentation hardware

### Code Structure

1. **Widget Organization**:
   - Extract reusable slide components into separate widgets
   - Create a consistent slide template/widget for repeated layouts
   - Organize slides in a dedicated directory structure (e.g., `lib/slides/`)

2. **Theme Configuration**:
   - Define a consistent theme using FlutterDeckThemeData
   - Set default text styles using League Spartan
   - Configure colors, spacing, and typography at the app level

3. **Constants and Configuration**:
   - Define presentation-specific constants (font sizes, spacing, colors) in a constants file
   - Use meaningful names like `kSlideTitleFontSize`, `kSlidePadding`, etc.

### Performance Considerations

1. **Asset Optimization**:
   - Optimize images for presentation quality while maintaining reasonable file sizes
   - Use appropriate image formats (WebP when possible)
   - Lazy load heavy assets if needed

2. **Rendering**:
   - Ensure smooth 60fps performance during transitions
   - Avoid expensive operations in build methods
   - Use const constructors where possible

### Best Practices

1. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure text is readable from a distance
   - Use semantic widgets and proper accessibility labels
   - Test with screen readers if applicable

2. **Testing**:
   - Test on actual presentation hardware when possible
   - Verify readability at various distances
   - Test in different lighting conditions

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Follow Effective Dart guidelines
   - Use const constructors for static content
   - Keep widgets focused and reusable
   - Document complex slide logic

### Example Patterns

**Text Styling Pattern**:
```dart
Text(
  'Slide Title',
  style: GoogleFonts.leagueSpartan(
    fontSize: 64,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w700,
    height: 1.2,
    letterSpacing: 0.5,
  ),
)
```

**Slide Padding Pattern**:
```dart
Padding(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(64.0),
  child: // slide content
)
```

**Theme Configuration Pattern**:
```dart
FlutterDeckThemeData(
  textTheme: FlutterDeckTextTheme(
    title: GoogleFonts.leagueSpartan(fontSize: 64, fontWeight: FontWeight.w700),
    subtitle: GoogleFonts.leagueSpartan(fontSize: 48, fontWeight: FontWeight.w600),
    body: GoogleFonts.leagueSpartan(fontSize: 32, fontWeight: FontWeight.w400),
  ),
)
```

## Summary
- Always use League Spartan font via GoogleFonts
- Use larger font sizes (minimum 18px, typically 24-72px)
- Generous spacing and padding (32-64px+)
- High contrast colors for readability
- Optimize for large screen viewing
- Follow flutter_deck best practices
- Consider macOS-specific presentation features
